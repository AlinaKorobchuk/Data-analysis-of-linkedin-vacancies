We want to help teams meet their business goals by better managing collective behaviors. It’s people that make things happen and if those people aren’t aligned - from a business and behavioral standpoint - ideas and projects fall flat. Through our suite of digital tools, we get to the heart of what behaviors are blocking or helping progress and we get comfortable with tackling uncomfortable topics. We put employees in the driver’s seat so that, at all levels, people feel empowered and celebrated. The impact we seek is not only for better results, but an opportunity to help unlock a positive change in people’s lives.      Our Team   We attract people who want to have an impact on people’s lives. They have a sense of purpose and clarity of what drives them outside of work and bring this energy into the company. They operate without ego, as part of a collective, to bring about change in the lives of others and in their own lives.       Our Company    We created Hubble_s to build a disruptive and scalable B2B SaaS platform. When surveyed, we found that most c-level executives say companies are, in essence, “Factories of Behaviors.” These managers agree that they do not have the tools they need to manage behaviors at scale. We fill this gap. With a successful track record of leveraging behavioral science, data, and our proprietary IP with large enterprise clients, we are now taking our platform to a wider audience to help managers at all levels align collective behaviors and make better decisions.

Je werkt veelal met SIGINT- en cyberdata uit een veelvoud van vaak incomplete datasets afkomstig uit diverse bronnen zoals social media, meta-, locatie- of tapgegevens en bestanden van partners. Je vertaalt deze informatie naar bruikbare inlichtingen voor de MIVD-teams. Je zoekt de grenzen op van wat technologisch haalbaar is en hebt een natuurlijke nieuwsgierigheid. Daarnaast ben je je bewust van de juridische kaders en werk je zorgvuldig en altijd met respect voor privacy. Je ziet problemen als uitdagingen en niet als obstakels en bent flexibel genoeg om je aan te passen aan een snel veranderende technologische wereld.   Je treedt op als vraagbaak voor de analisten in de multidisciplinaire teams en houdt rekening met het feit dat deze vaak niet dezelfde technische kennis hebben als jij en jouw mede data analisten. Je bent op de hoogte van de nieuwste technologieën en de inzetbaarheid daarvan voor de teams.   Je deelt jouw technische kennis en methodes met collega’s en de organisatie zodat die zich verder kunnen ontwikkelen.   Wie zoeken we   Je combineert een scherp analytisch vermogen waarbij kennis van het Cyber domein, IP, ICT infrastructuren, netwerk of securitycomponenten een pré is. Kandidaten met deze achtergrond worden nadrukkelijk gevraagd te solliciteren. Je bent in staat complexe vraagstukken te vertalen naar gerichte datavragen en deze met de passende beschikbare middelen te beantwoorden. Je weet hoe je methodisch grote datasets moet bevragen met het doel hier voor jouw team relevante informatie uit te extraheren. Je gaat nauwkeurig te werk, legt verbanden en trekt gegronde conclusies. Je beschikt over goede communicatieve vaardigheden om de resultaten van je onderzoek op een heldere manier over te brengen op je afnemers en je collega’s.

Tot de secundaire arbeidsvoorwaarden behoren onder meer betaald ouderschapsverlof (onder voorwaarden), studiefaciliteiten, een extra verlofregeling voor ouderen en een vergoeding woon-werkverkeer.   De organisatie Militaire Inlichtingen- en Veiligheidsdienst   De Militaire Inlichtingen- en Veiligheidsdienst (MIVD) is onderdeel van het ministerie van Defensie. De dienst ondersteunt bij het gereedstellen van de eenheden en bij militaire missies en vredesoperaties. Hiervoor verwerven we wereldwijd inlichtingen en veiligheidsinformatie op strategisch, tactisch en operationeel niveau. De MIVD speelt zo een cruciale rol bij de besluitvorming door de militaire leiding en de politieke top.   Werk je bij de MIVD, dan doe je werk dat er echt toe doet. Je draagt bij aan het beschermen van de Nederlandse belangen en de nationale veiligheid. Bovendien werk je in een zeer dynamische omgeving. We doen er alles aan om te zorgen dat je op jouw vakgebied up-to-date blijft, bijvoorbeeld door middel van opleidingen en kennisuitwisseling met onze partnerdiensten.   Omdat je bij de inlichtingen- en veiligheidsdienst werkt en met gevoelige informatie te maken krijgt, kun je de inhoud van je werk niet met je vrienden en familie bespreken. Maar wel met je collega’s. Daarom bouw je een bijzondere band op met hen. Er heerst een sterke onderlinge verbondenheid die er mede voor zorgt dat de meeste mensen lang bij de organisatie blijven werken. En allemaal werken we aan hetzelfde doel: de fysieke en digitale veiligheid van 17 miljoen Nederlanders.   Binnen de MIVD zijn er diverse (contra-)inlichtingenteams waarin je nauw samenwerkt met analisten, bewerkers en collega’s van verwerving. Er zijn teams die gespecialiseerd zijn in een land of regio, maar er zijn ook teams die zich bezighouden met thema’s als terrorisme of cyber. In welk team jij aan de slag gaat, is afhankelijk van jouw kennis en kwaliteiten. Samen bespreken we dus wat het beste bij je past. Dat betekent niet dat je altijd in het zelfde team blijft werken; het is goed mogelijk dat je af en toe wisselt van team.   De afdeling Bureau Data Analyse   Het Bureau Data Analyse (BDA) levert specialistische personele capaciteit voor het analyseren van diverse complexe databronnen. De data-analist maakt deel uit van deze capaciteit en is daarmee een koppelvlak tussen de JSCU en de multidisciplinaire teams van de MIVD, AIVD en (inter)nationale partners.   Bijzonderheden   Wees terughoudend met het bekendmaken dat u voor de MIVD wilt werken. Dit levert mogelijk risico’s voor u op.   Een veiligheidsonderzoek is onderdeel van de sollicitatieprocedure.   Om in aanmerking te komen voor een functie bij de MIVD moet je de Nederlandse nationaliteit hebben en (in principe) de afgelopen tien jaar in Nederland hebben gewoond. Ook aan je eventuele partner en andere mensen in je omgeving worden bepaalde eisen gesteld.   De vacature wordt zowel intern als extern defensie gepubliceerd. Eventuele interne kandidaten worden in de selectieprocedure eerst behandeld alvorens de selectie wordt uitgebreid met externe kandidaten.   De functie leent zich niet voor thuiswerken i.v.m. het gerubriceerde karakter van de informatieverwerking.   Je werkt bij een militaire organisatie. Dit betekent dat je op vrijwillige basis kunt worden uitgezonden om SIGINT-ondersteuning te leveren aan een militaire missie.   Werken in het Inlichtingen- en Veiligheidsdomein is onvoorspelbaar. Het is daarom mogelijk dat je verzocht wordt om buiten reguliere kantoortijden inzetbaar te zijn. Het kan voorkomen dat je wegens omstandigheden voor bepaalde tijd andere werkzaamheden verricht dan hierboven beschreven.   De MIVD opereert ten allen tijde binnen de kaders van de Wet op de inlichtingen- en veiligheidsdiensten 2017 (Wiv 2017). Als data analist handel je altijd naar de richtlijnen die hierin zijn vastgesteld.   Medewerkers van Bureau Data Analyse zijn zowel in Zoetermeer als in Den Haag werkzaam.

We are home to a family of 3 strong brands, Bloom &amp; Wild, bloomon and Bergamotte, having acquired bloomon in April 2021 and Bergamotte in July 2021. Together, we are active in 8 countries.

Supply Chain and Quality - You will help this team to measure the quality of products including non floral gifts. You will create reporting to ensure that we achieve a high customer NPS and provide recommendations if you identify any areas for improvement.   Customer delight- You will support the customer delight team to understand the performance of our help centre, providing recommendations on areas we could look to improve.   This role will be a combination of building reporting and investigative analysis. You will be able to navigate the opportunities/challenges of both.   You are focused on the most valuable and high impact work and are not afraid to push back on requests if they do not have a clear impact/use.   This role is fast paced, so it will be important that you'll be able to identify quick wins and make trade-offs while maintaining analytical best practice.

To maximise learning and cross-collaboration, the UK commercial and trading teams, and the majority of the UK teams we collaborate with, work from our London office 2-3 days per week.

Onze advertentieproposities spelen een belangrijke rol in de ambities van bol.com: Ze helpen shoppers producten te ontdekken en adverteerders relevante klanten te bereiken. Hier ga jij het verschil maken! Want data helpt bij het nemen van goede beslissingen, geeft richting aan de juiste gesprekken en verandert de perceptie waar nodig. Jij zorgt dat die data efficiënt en effectief wordt gebruikt.    De grootste uitdaging    Adverteren via Bol groeit in rap tempo en wordt steeds belangrijker voor bol.com. Het aantal collega’s, het aantal initiatieven en de complexiteit van de techniek nemen snel toe. Daarom is er steeds meer behoefte aan data. Om te blijven accelereren hebben we scherpe KPI’s, integrerende analyses, en betrouwbare voorspellingen nodig. Als Data Analist Advertising ben jij hier van onschatbare waarde!    Wat doe je als Data Analist    Jij ontsluit tijdige, relevante en betrouwbare data voor je team én voor stakeholders van het advertising domein. Je analyseert, bewerkt, verrijkt en modelleert (ruwe) data. Je ontwikkelt ook de juiste dashboards en rapportages, waarmee collega’s goed onderbouwde beslissingen kunnen nemen.  Je bent een kritische denker en blijft doorleren om analysetechnieken en KPI-ontwikkeling aan te scherpen. Nieuwe methoden en technieken uitproberen? Past helemaal in jouw straatje! Nieuwe datasets en issues analyseren? Jij zet daar je tanden in. Projecten succesvol naar de finish brengen? Jouw specialiteit!

De code maak je eenvoudig schaalbaar (want het datavolume groeit gestaag)     3 redenen waarom dit (n)iets voor jou is     - Als je niet graag in het onbekende bevindt Nee, als je nerveus wordt van de vrijheid om te pionieren, van autonoom werken en van alle ambiguïteit die daarbij hoort.    - Als je alleen blij wordt van met data spelen Nee, als je alleen met data wil stoeien en vindt dat we iemand anders moeten zoeken voor het managen van projecten en stakeholders    - Als je denkt geen domein kennis nodig te hebben Nee, als je geen zin hebt om in de wereld van advertising te duiken.

Data- ja analytiikkaliiketoimintamme kasvun myötä etsimme uusia ammattilaisia joukkoomme.      Mistä on kyse?   Data &amp; Analytics -liiketoiminnallamme on pitkä kokemus analyyttisista sovelluksista, joissa suurten tietomassojen käsittely ja hallinta ovat arkipäivää. Suunnittelemme ja toteutamme asiakkaillemme tiedonhallinnan ja analytiikan ratkaisuja, jotka palvelevat ja mahdollistavat monipuolisen tiedon hyödyntämisen suoraan liiketoiminnan tarpeisiin. Valitsemme käyttämämme teknologiat aina asiakastarpeen mukaisesti, mutta hyödynnämme ratkaisuissamme erityisesti Azurea.     Työssäsi pääset varmistamaan, että asiakkaamme hyödyntävät keräämäänsä dataa mahdollisimman tehokkaasti. Suunnittelet uusia tiedonhallinnan ja analytiikan ratkaisuja, ja työskentelet asiakasprojekteissamme tai pienkehitystehtävissä. Työskentelet keskimäärin kahdessa projektissa kerrallaan ja projektien kesto vaihtelee muutamasta kuukaudesta vuoteen. Rooliasi voidaan muotoilla osaamisesi ja tavoitteidesi mukaisesti. Työviikkoihin kuuluu käytännön kehitystyön lisäksi yhteistyötä ja erilaisia tapaamisia kollegoiden ja asiakkaan kanssa.     Työntekopaikkasi on osaavassa porukassa Espoon, Lahden, Tampereen tai Kuopion toimistoillamme, mutta jos olet kokenut osaaja, onnistuu työn tekeminen etänä mistä tahansa Suomessa. Toki välillä voi tulla tilanteita, että koko tiimi tekee töitä myös asiakkaan tiloissa. Löydät aina kokenutta sparrailuseuraa useista eri tiimeistämme ja työskenteletkin noin 150 ammattilaisemme ja eri asiantuntijatiimiemme kanssa Suomessa ja Ruotsissa.

Dat doe je door diepgaande ( SQL ) analyses op onze complexe datasets &amp; tools los te laten, waardoor we on-site klantgedrag beter doorgronden . De hypotheses die jij samen met marketing en shopping collega’s aandraagt , vormen vaak de basis van je research. De insights deel je via krachtige PowerPoints of (Tableau/Data Studio) dashboards met collega’s die de klantervaring optimaliseren . Dankzij jou maken we de juiste keuzes hoe we onze website en app het beste kunnen inrichten .     Wat je doet als Junior/Medior Web Data Analyst?     Je bent het ‘datageweten’ van collega’s binnen het Marketing &amp; Shopping domein en voorziet hen non-stop van richtinggevende inzichten. Dat start met het inventariseren en soms flink abstraheren van business– of eigen hypotheses, met als doel deze hypothese te laten leiden naar commercieel succes. Je schuwt hierbij het leggen van nieuwe verbanden of het flink versimpelen van complexiteit niet. Jouw primaire bronnen hebben alles te maken met klantgedrag op onze website. Van streams met view- en klikgedrag per pagina-feature, tot customer journey data met navigatiegedrag en conversiepaden. Enorm rijk en complex datalandschap dus! Om die succesvol te kunnen verzilveren is het belangrijk dat je een stevige dosis query–kennis koppelt aan een enthousiaste pioniersdrive, want je werkt met complexe, soms nieuwe data.  Het is cruciaal dat je niet metingen implementeert en analyseert   for science’s sake   , maar omdat je een positief verschil voor collega’s en klanten wilt maken: impact is waar je voor gaat. Dit begint het met meedenken met collega’s op het moment dat er meetwensen zijn, die je vastlegt met een meetplan en samen met IT development implementeert. Je formuleert je conclusies en aanbevelingen pakkend en inspirerend zodat collega’s er graag mee aan de slag gaan. Ook werk je, samen met v ijf collega’s, aan eigenaarschap over de klantreis, onze front-end datadefinities en de kwaliteit van de metingen, zodat we zeker weten dat de hele organisatie hetzelfde bedoelt en ziet. Uiteraard pilot je als Web Data Analyst verschillende tooling en probeer je nieuwe KPI’s uit webdata te destilleren – KPI’s die de business inzicht en incentives bieden. Je houdt je bezig met een mix van data analyse /implementatie (50%), stakeholder management (25%) en conceptueel denkwerk (25%).     Je raakt wegwijs in de rijke webdatabronnen en tools van bol.com en ondersteunt onze gebruikers in hun zelfstandigheid met data (o.a. middels training en self-service)    Je onderzoekt het effect van klantgedrag op business performance en haalt de meest relevante inzichten naar boven     Je presenteert die inzichten inspirerend en overtuigend (collega’s moeten er meteen mee aan de slag willen) in PowerPoint, notebooks en/of via dashboards     Je bent mede-eigenaar van de klantreis, front-end data-definities, metrics &amp; metingen    Je experimenteert graag en vaak en hebt 1-2 jaar data analyse ervaring. Ervaring met Adobe Analytics en tagplannen opstellen is een pre.

Wil jij bijdragen aan de meest duurzame en soepele afwikkeling van de diverse retourstromen?    Waarom je het verschil kunt maken    Retourstromen lijken eenvoudig beheersbaar, maar bij bol.com is dat een complexe flow. Bijvoorbeeld omdat retouren 33 miljoen shapes &amp; sizes hebben. Bovendien worden veel artikelen verkocht door zakelijke partners, maar gepicked, gepackt en verstuurd door bol.com zelf. Deze dienst ‘Logistiek via bol.com’ verzorgt ook de retourafhandeling. Van eigen assortiment en steeds vaker van onze partners. Het team Return Solutions zorgt voor een optimaal retourenproces in ons eigen retourenwarehouse en heeft als doel dat we zoveel mogelijk producten terug op voorraad kunnen leggen, of als dat niet lukt er maximale waarde uit te halen en het artikel een ‘tweede leven’ te geven. Een interessant speelveld in het hart van bol.com, waarin je met veel verschillende afdelingen binnen en buiten Logistiek het verschil kunt maken.    De grootste uitdaging    Bol.com heeft de afgelopen jaren de transitie gemaakt van ‘traditionele’ online winkel naar toonaangevend retail tech platform. Daarbij zijn retouren in absolute zin flink toegenomen, wat heeft bijgedragen aan het besluit om een specialistisch retourenwarehouse te bouwen. Komende periode worden de laatste delen van dit nieuwe retourencentrum opgeleverd. Hier liggen dus nog genoeg kansen voor doorontwikkeling. Daarnaast liggen er nog kansen in de aansluiting op de verschillende goederenstromen na retourverwerking. De ambitie: een extreem soepel end-to-end retourverwerkingsproces, waarbij we zoveel mogelijk automatiseren, de keuzes optimaal met software en/of mechanisatie ondersteunen en een optimale balans vinden tussen waardebehoud van de retourstroom en de kosten die we maken.    Wat je doet als Data Analyst Return Solutions    Als Data Analyst Return Solutions ben je expert op het gebied van data-gedreven denken en werken. Jij ontsluit tijdige, relevante en betrouwbare data voor je team maar ook voor andere stakeholders van het retour domein. Je verricht analyses, bewerkt, verrijkt en modelleert (ruwe) data en ontwikkelt de juiste dashboards en rapportages. Dashboards en rapportages dus die collega’s in staat stellen om goed onderbouwde beslissingen te nemen.    Je maakt impactvolle dashboards waarbij je kijkt naar de hele flow in het retourencentrum    Je ontwikkelt technische skills voor data-analyse (denk aan SQL, Tableau, Excel, etc.)    Je helpt collega’s bij complexe analyses en modelleringen, waarbij jij vaak net die creatieve route kunt plotten die collega’s ontgaat    Je analyseert processen en haalt het net op bij stakeholders: zitten er afwijkende vissen tussen? En wat kunnen we daar aan doen?    Je vertaalt inzichten naar requirements, business cases en concrete acties      Waarom jij het verschil kunt maken    Omdat jij twee gaven combineert: talent voor het opdoen van de juiste inzichten en het vermogen om je team daarin mee te nemen. Data modelleren richting meetbare output en impact is je passie. Verder verwachten we dat je een zelfstarter bent; iemand die graag op zoek gaat naar de grootste kansen en daar werk van maakt. Daar slaag je in op basis van een mix van inhoudelijke kennis, analytische vaardigheden, samenwerkingsbereidheid en de oprechte drive om anderen met jouw inzichten te verrassen en verder te helpen. We zijn op zoek naar een data analist die niet schrikt van grote en complexe bakken met data en staat te trappelen om zijn/haar analyses hierop los te laten.   3 redenen waarom dit (n)iets voor jou is     - Het hele pakket Nee, als je heel goed bent in analyses, maar de interpretatie graag elders belegt    - Meer dan data alleen Nee, als je een pure big data rol ambieert    - Business-relevantie Nee, als de relevantie voor de business niet zo interessant vindt    + Data is king Ja, als je4+ jaar relevante werkervaring hebt en thuis bent in Tableau en/of BigQuery    + You own it, you love it Ja, als je het leuk vindt om vanaf dag één ‘eigenaar’ van jouw data-modellen te zijn    + Een beter milieu… Ja, als je in het kader van duurzaamheid graag bijdraagt aan een mooi nieuw plekje in de maatschappij voor elk retour gestuurd pakket      Hier kom je terecht    Als Data Analyst Return Solutions werk je binnen onze snelgroeiende logistieke operatie. Dat is verre van een ondergeschoven kindje, want bol.com beschouwt de kwaliteit van de logistieke services als drijver van de klanttevredenheid. Return Solutions is een multidisciplinair team die zich vooral richt op proces optimalisatie en waardebehoud van retouren. Je werkt samen met Business Analisten, Product Owners, Data analisten en Software Engineers.  Je werkt primair op ons hoofdkantoor in Utrecht, maar gaat ook regelmatig naar Waalwijk om het retourenproces van dichtbij te bekijken.    Wij creëren een omgeving waarin we de kracht van diversiteit benutten.                         ",75.0

Whooz is onbetwist marktleider en dat willen we graag blijven. Onze medewerkers hebben veel kennis en ervaring, zijn innovatief, hebben grote ambities en vooral veel plezier. Ons team bestaat uit enthousiaste medewerkers, die met elkaar zorgen dat we onze klanten nóg beter, efficiënter en daadkrachtiger kunnen helpen met het bereiken van hun doelen.      Whooz koestert een informele en nieuwsgierige cultuur waar mensen oprecht blij worden van data. Van leuk werk, komt goed werk, nietwaar? En als dit werk tot nieuwe toepasbare inzichten leidt, worden we al helemaal vrolijk. Dat verveelt nooit en dat merken we elke dag.       Puzzelen met data    De toepassing staat voorop    Zelfstandig in een team    Jezelf ontwikkelen door onze dienstverlening te ontwikkelen    Eigenwijs    Hybride werken      #WhoozLovingData          DATA ANALIST – startersfunctie      Kom jij net van hogeschool of universiteit en heb je zin om in de praktijk echt met data aan de slag te gaan, dan hebben we voor jou de juiste functie! Bij Whooz helpen we in een team met specialisten elke dag onze klanten om met data antwoorden te geven op marketing- en locatievraagstukken.     Dus puzzel jij graag met veel data en creëer je graag waarde voor onze klanten door data om te zetten naar inzichten? Dan ben jij wellicht degene die we zoeken.     Wat we bieden is een mooie functie waarbij je data bewerkt en analyseert om vervolgens waardevolle inzichten te creëren voor onze klanten. Niet de data, de tool of de methodologie staat voorop, maar de toepassing van de klant! Stap voor stap begeleiden we jou op een informele manier, zodat je leert hoe jouw analytische skills waarde brengen aan de hand van concrete vraagstukken binnen klantanalyse, -werving en -behoud.     Al snel voer je in het team van analisten zelfstandig en in teamverband analyses uit voor onze opdrachtgevers. Daarnaast doe je dataleveringen aan licentieklanten en ondersteun je onze klanten in het vinden van waarde in data. Je bent nauwkeurig en analytisch en vindt het leuk om concreet aan de slag te zijn met data en klanten.     We snappen dat je wellicht nog niet 100% weet wat je wil voor de rest van de carrière en daarom is er binnen Whooz altijd ruimte om aan de hand van je interesse en/of nieuwe vragen uit de markt nieuwe technieken te proberen en nieuwe toepassingen te ontwikkelen. Bijvoorbeeld door een nieuwe manier en/of vorm te bedenken waarop we inzichten generen voor onze klanten of door mee te werken aan de ontwikkeling van een nieuw product.     Het allerbelangrijkste voor ons is dat je echt enthousiast wordt van data en analyses en dat je altijd nieuwsgierig bent naar nieuwe inzichten. Aangezien veel van onze klanten werken in het marketingveld is het fijn als je affiniteit hebt met (online) marketingtoepassingen. Vanzelfsprekend ben je veel met data in de weer, maar je schroomt niet om aan de klant je gevonden inzichten te presenteren, je advies toe te lichten en proactief met hem mee te denken.         Wat bieden we        Onze medewerkers vinden het fijn dat er een informele sfeer en open cultuur heerst binnen Whooz, waarbij we binnen het team samen de klant helpen en onze doelen behalen. Ook is er altijd ruimte voor eigen inzicht en ideeën. Ben je een beetje eigenwijs? Helemaal goed want dat zijn wij ook. We bieden een marktconform salaris en bieden je ruimte om je binnen je werk te ontwikkelen. De meeste dagen werken we met elkaar op ons ruime kantoor nabij het centrum van Den Haag, maar er is zeker ook ruimte en flexibiliteit om een deel van de dagen thuis te werken.         Functie-eisen      Naast dat iemand met HBO/WO werk- en denkniveau zoeken, vinden we het belangrijkste voor deze functie is, dat je iedere keer weer enthousiast wordt van data en analyses en de mogelijkheden die deze bieden voor organisaties. Vanzelfsprekend is het wenselijk dat je beschikt over analytische vaardigheden (statistiek, clustering, modellering, dashboarding) en datamanagement vaardigheden (dataprocessen inrichten en runnen). Kennis van het toepassen van technieken, zoals web scraping en artificiële intelligentie, voor het verzamelen en genereren van data is een pré. Je bent daarnaast servicegericht, professioneel, zelfbewust, communicatief vaardig en kunt zelfstandig, maar ook samen werken. Voor communicatie met onze klanten is een goede beheersing van de Nederlandse taal een must.        Ben jij de oplossingsgerichte dataliefhebber die wij zoeken? Neem dan contact met ons op. Je kunt je motivatie en CV sturen naar info@whooz.nl t.a.v. Peter.      We zien bij Whooz absoluut de toegevoegde waarde van recruiters in sommige wervingstrajecten. Acquisitie en benadering door recruiters op basis van deze vacature wordt echter niet op prijs gesteld!                             ",19.0

Funded by our recent Series B investment , we're on a journey to expand and grow by hiring top talent across the security industry.   Every application threatens businesses with new supply chain risks. ReversingLabs is the only company that can dissect any binary at unprecedented speed, scale, and explainability to protect the enterprise end-to-end.   Our mission is to help IT professionals secure their code from supply chain threats. If this sounds interesting and you wondered what the Log4j fuss in the news was all about, you can become a part of our solution that secures the software release process for publishers, and manage third party risk for software buyers. We are seeking extraordinary talent to help forge this transformational journey at ReversingLabs. Your future role as a Data Scientist is extremely important to the success of our solution - secure.software platform for software assurance. This is a game-changing opportunity.    About The Team    The machine learning team is a part of the Research group in ReversingLabs. The projects include data-driven approaches to file type identification, malware classification, detection of hidden payloads, and extraction of file properties related to security. These projects complement the more conventional static analysis techniques developed by threat analysts and reverse engineers in the group, and aim to be practical for threats present in real-world data distributions. For data, we leverage the existing ReversingLabs file reputation collections and feeds of novel samples received from security industry feeds, threat intelligence, and in-house harvesting. Other than straightforward product-oriented projects, we also engage in more research-oriented endeavors aimed at threat hunting, threat intelligence, and data quality in our file metadata collections. As a part of our team, you will also have the chance to work on large language model research projects. The biggest challenge of the machine learning team is working with complex data and a shifting data distribution. This often requires an investigative mindset and cooperation with threat analysts and reverse engineers to create finely tuned and reliable solutions.    Responsibilities    As a Data scientist, you would analyze data to define the scope of individual projects, create datasets, create and test predictive models, and monitor the performance of models on real-world data. The ideal set of skills would be data analysis, cybersecurity domain awareness, general machine learning and modeling, and experience with robust models deployed in production environments, but the position is also an opportunity to develop these skills.

Business Analyst,Amsterdam, Netherlands,Hybrid,HEMA,"10,001+ employees",Retail,"<span class=""visually-hidden""><!-- -->Skills: Business Analysis, Product Service, +8 more<!-- --></span>","                              join the retail tech revolution!   HEMA heeft honderden internationale vestigingen – groot of wat kleiner, zelf geëxploiteerd of door enthousiaste franchisenemers – en een (gezellig!) groeiende kantoorpopulatie. Dat maakt ons tot een applicatie-intensieve organisatie. ‘De truc’ is niet om deze applicaties live te krijgen, maar om ze voor onze collega’s blijvend te laten werken. Dat vraagt om meer dan tech expertise, want het gaat om het ondersteunen van de business processen en te begrijpen waar daar de uitdagingen en kansen liggen. Eens? Welkom bij Digital!      Maak onalledaags veel impact!   Als Business Analist onboarden we je binnen het Digital HR team, onderdeel van de bredere CTO organisatie. De sfeer? Gezellig en ontspannen maar tegelijkertijd gedreven. De uitdagingen? Elke dag anders, maar het oppakken en uitwerken van business verzoeken, en het uitvoeren van scenario analyses zijn in ieder geval onderdeel van de rol van Business Analist. Samen met de product owners, solution architecten, HR management en nog andere collega’s vanuit HR en IT draag je bij aan de digitale transformatie van HEMA. Dit is een rol met onalledaags veel impact, want er liggen nog veel verbeterpunten om onze collega’s in de winkels, op de distributiecentra en het hoofdkantoor optimaal te ondersteunen om de klant op één te kunnen zetten. De inzet is dus hoog. Net als de uiteindelijke opbrengst.     Je bent als Business Analist succesvol als je in staat bent om duidelijk in kaart te brengen waar de huidige uitdagingen liggen én wat mogelijke oplossingen zijn. Je doet dit in samenwerking met de Product Owners en DevOps engineers in het team en de stakeholders van de business.  De setting van HEMA is complexer dan in de meeste corporate omgevingen, omdat alles binnen HEMA ‘fast-moving’ is en trekjes van een tech scale-up (na 17 energiedrankjes) vertoont. Niets is in steen gebeiteld, en sommige structuren en processen ontbreken nog. Zo’n werkomgeving vraagt om eigenaarschap, het bepalen van de juiste prioriteiten en het lef om andere meningen mee te wegen.     Het komende jaar staat in het teken van een aantal grote projecten, zoals de implementatie van een nieuw workforce management systeem en het herdefiniëren van de rollen en processen van de HR selfservice en payroll applicaties. Als Business Analist speel je hierin een cruciale rol, door de huidige situatie in kaart te brengen en de uitdagingen in deze situatie gecombineerd met de business behoeften te vertalen in oplossingen en scenario’s.  Jij bedenkt dus voor een groot deel hoe HEMA de komende jaren gaat werken.      De ‘snel even langs HEMA’ versie    Je brengt zaken duidelijk, overzichtelijk en zo simpel mogelijk in kaart: van de functionaliteiten van de applicaties tot de huidige pijnpunten en uitdagingen  Je bent een goede sparringpartner voor de stakeholders: je helpt hen te definiëren wat ze nodig hebben en vertaalt dit naar mogelijke oplossingen  Je bijt je graag vast in complexe ‘puzzels’, maar houdt zaken zelf het liefst eenvoudig  Jij bedenkt hoe we de HR processen het beste kunnen ondersteunen met bestaande en nieuwe applicaties  Je signaleert bottlenecks en draagt actief verbeteringen aan  Je kan kennis goed overbrengen binnen een team van gelijkgezinden maar ook naar eindgebruikers       Dit haal je bij HEMA    Een bruto salaris tussen 3700 en 5500 euro  Reis- en onkostenvergoeding, een vaste (!) bonus van 4%, een variabele bonus van max 14%, pensioenregeling en een royale korting op alles wat HEMA (on)alledaags goed maakt  Bewegingsvrijheid: HEMA keurslijft je niet  Ontwikkeltempo: je leert van je collega’s en hebt de optie trainingen te volgen  Een unieke setting met een organisatie met vele gezichten: online tech scale-up, gepokt en gemazelde retailer, productontwikkelaar/producent en een grote internationale speler  Flexibiliteit: waar jij je beste werk doet, mag je (in overleg) werken  Fijn hoofdkantoor: Op de NDSM werf. Boven een levendige HEMA.  De kans om het alledaagse leven van miljoenen mensen onalledaags leuker te maken       Dit neem je naar HEMA mee    WO denkniveau en minimaal 3 jaar werkervaring, bij voorkeur bij een (IT) consultancy of binnen de IT afdeling van een middelgroot of groot bedrijf  Sterk analytisch denkvermogen: je hebt snel door hoe zaken in elkaar zitten en kan dit ook aan anderen uitleggen  Je haalt er energie uit om orde te scheppen in chaos  Je heb affiniteit met techniek, maar snapt dat het gaat om het creëren van waarde  Je voelt je thuis in een dynamische omgeving waar zaken snel (kunnen) veranderen                          ",55.0
